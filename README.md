# Dad joke generator

> This is a simple random generator which spits out dad jokes
> The tool is written in vanilla JavaScript and a practice project suggested by codecademy

## Purpose of this projects

The purpose of this project is to practice some of the JavaScript conecpts I have learned in JavaScript Syntax I & II as well as create a project on my machine instead of the codecademy sandbox.

### Project objectives:

- Build a message generator program using vanilla JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer
- Use GitHub to make your project remotely available

### Project planning:

1. We create an array filled with dad jokes we gather from the internet
2. Create a function that choses a joke from the array by random, it should also work if we later add something
3. Call the function several times to see if it really spits out random jokes

### Added scope:

1. make it possible to add more jokes to the array
2. create function that let's the user chose a specific joke from the array by putting in a key word
